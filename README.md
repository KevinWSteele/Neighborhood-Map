# Neighborhood-Map

You can see markers pointing out some of my favorite places in Edinburgh.

If you click on a marker, you will see some more information about the place as well as a link to the place's website.

On the side of the map is a list of places. If you click on a place name, the marker on the map will turn red and you 
can see the info window for the place pop up. 

If you click on the Instagram icon, you can see photos tagged for the currently clicked place. To exit out of the the pop-up, click the X in the upper right corner.

There is a search bar. If you type the start of a name in the search bar, the list will be filtered so you only see
the places that start with the typed letters.

I hope you enjoy exploring this beautiful Scottish city.
